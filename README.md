# Nike-Clone
My CW Project 
Nike, Inc. is an American multinational corporation that is engaged in the design, development, manufacturing, and worldwide marketing and sales of footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services. Nike.com is the website used by Nike to deliver innovative products, experiences and services to inspire athletes. We have tried to clone the website using HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript DOM. This was a collaborative project at MASAI school.
